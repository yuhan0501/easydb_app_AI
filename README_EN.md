## 📖 Introduction

EasyDB is a lightweight desktop data query tool built with Rust that queries local files directly using SQL. With a built-in DataFusion query engine, there is no need to install additional databases or other tools. It treats files as database tables, enabling querying of CSV, Excel, JSON, and other formats using standard SQL, supporting complex multi-table JOINs, subqueries, window functions, and other advanced SQL features. It effortlessly handles large text files from hundreds of MB to multiple GB and requires relatively minimal hardware resources.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Core Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend**: Rust + Tauri
- **Query Engine**: [apache/datafusion](https://github.com/apache/datafusion)
- **UI Framework**: HeroUI + Tailwind CSS

### Query Engine Selection

**Currently Using**: DataFusion

DataFusion is part of the Apache Arrow project, providing complete SQL query capabilities and supporting complex SQL syntax, including multi-table JOINs, subqueries, window functions, and other advanced features. Compared to Polars, DataFusion offers more comprehensive SQL compatibility, meeting more complex query requirements.

**Version Evolution**: Version v1.0 previously used the Polars engine. While Polars excelled in stream processing and memory usage, it had limitations in supporting complex SQL queries. Version v2.0 switched back to DataFusion to gain more complete SQL support while maintaining good performance and resource utilization efficiency.

## 📚 User Guide

### Basic Syntax

```sql
-- Query CSV files
SELECT *
FROM read_csv('/path/to/file.csv', infer_schema => true, has_header => true)
WHERE "age" > 30
LIMIT 10;

-- Query Excel files (multiple sheets)
SELECT *
FROM read_excel('/path/to/file.xlsx', sheet_name => 'Sheet2')
WHERE "age" > 30
LIMIT 10;

-- Query line-delimited JSON (NdJson) files
SELECT *
FROM read_ndjson('/path/to/file.ndjson')
WHERE "status" = 'active';

-- Query MySQL database
SELECT *
FROM read_mysql('users', conn => 'mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/mydb')
WHERE "age" > 30
LIMIT 200;
```

### Supported File Formats

| Format  | Function         | Description                                      |
| ------- | ---------------- |-------------------------------------------------|
| CSV     | `read_csv()`     | Supports custom delimiters and headers          |
| Excel   | `read_excel()`   | Supports multiple worksheets (Beta)             |
| NdJson  | `read_ndjson()`  | One JSON object per line (line-delimited JSON)  |
| Parquet | `read_parquet()` | Columnar storage format for large-scale analytics|

## 🚀 Quick Start

### System Requirements

- **macOS**: 10.15+ (Catalina or higher)
- **Windows**: Windows 10 or higher
- **Memory**: Recommended 4GB or more
- **Storage**: At least 100MB available space

### Installation

1. **Download Installer**

   - Visit [Releases](https://github.com/shencangsheng/easydb_app/releases) page
   - Download the installer for your system

2. **Install Application**

   - **macOS**: Download `.dmg` file, drag to Applications folder
   - **Windows**: Download `.exe` file, run the installer

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### macOS Application Corruption Issue

**Issue**: Getting "Application is damaged and cannot be opened" error when trying to open EasyDB on macOS

**Solution**: This is caused by macOS's security mechanism (Gatekeeper) blocking unsigned applications. Please follow these steps to resolve:

1. Open Terminal
2. Execute the following command to remove quarantine attributes:
   ```bash
   xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/EasyDB.app
   ```
3. Try opening the application again

**Alternative Solution**: If the above method doesn't work, you can try allowing the application in System Preferences:

1. Open "System Preferences" > "Security & Privacy"
2. In the "General" tab, find the blocked application
3. Click the "Open Anyway" button

### Syntax Problem

Field names can be wrapped in double quotes, for example:

```sql
SELECT "id", "name" FROM table WHERE "id" = 1;
```

Can also be wrapped in backticks, for example:

```sql
SELECT `id`, `name` FROM table WHERE `id` = 1;
```

String values in WHERE clauses should be wrapped in single quotes, for example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table WHERE "id" = '1';
```

## 📖 Project Background

### From Server to App

[EasyDB Server](https://github.com/shencangsheng/easy_db) is mainly deployed on Linux servers as a web service supporting efficient querying of large-scale text files. Although Docker deployment solutions are provided, usage on macOS is still not convenient enough.

For this reason, I developed the EasyDB App client, specifically optimized for macOS and Windows platforms to improve the local user experience.

### Project Naming

To better distinguish between the two projects:

- **EasyDB Server**: Server-side version, based on DataFusion
- **EasyDB App**: Desktop client version, based on DataFusion (v2.0+)
